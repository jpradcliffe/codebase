## CodeBase
An on the fly reference of tried and tested code blocks

### details
An application which I can use to store and categorize blocks of tried and tested code either written by myself or from other sources; in doing so I can have a local on the fly reference to use when developing, minimize typing duplicate code blocks, minimize time researching online, even refer to it in offline mode :)
